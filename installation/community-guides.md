## [Replit Guide](https://gist.github.com/anondev-sudo/24978429b85b44348bcff5c0885afe82) by AnonDev

An online code execution environment which used to be free with certain exploids but starting 2024 replit removed the free tier. You can deploy modmail there if you pay for their monthly plans/deployment costs. For the up-to--date pricing info check out their [pricing](https://replit.com/pricing) page.

## [Northflank](https://blog.project-mei.xyz/posts/2023-08-02-hosting-modmail-on-northflank.html) Guide by raidensakura

Northflank is a Platform as a Service (PaaS) like Railway that offers abilities to run micro-services like bots, schedule jobs that run periodically and databases with a powerful UI, API and CLI. Their panel is a bit more advanced as compared to Railway but comes with the perk of more customization and features. You will need a valid payment method to verify your account, but will unlock a free tier project that's separated from paid resources. They will not charge your card if you go over resource usage as you have limited allocation per service.
